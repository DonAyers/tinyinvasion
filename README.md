Tiny Invasion
===================
View the site [here][1].

The site was meant to be a simple portfolio type site showcasing music for movies and television. 

It is an implementation of the  [ FullPage.js ][2]responsive jQuery plugin. This Plugin is actually quite powerful and intuitive. It acts more as a responsive frame work than a simple slider plugin.

The site  is responsive and the window will trigger a css reset via JS when the window size is changed. No dissapearing elements.

To save on server space the sound player is a simple soundcloud widget who actually has great support for every browser. They are using the [soundmanager2][3]library which is js with a flash fallback. 

As a little bonus I threw in some jQuery animations to make the page more fun.
The background for the first page actually changes to reflect the time of day.
